An amusing thing I just stumbled across; the guy who posted it, swears he just composed it off the top of his head with no AI assistance:

A is for array, some things in a list
B is for byte, how computers exist
C is for character, one letter in a word
D is for destination, where results are stored
E is for event, interaction in the DOM
F is for file, sometimes written to ROM
G is for graph, some edges and nodes
H is for handle, it references loads
I is for index, add 1 as time flies
J is for index, but different from i's
K is for key, in associative arrays
L is for length, as in how many j?
M is for mode, and not like ice cream
N is for count, like sheep in a dream
O is for object, some data and code
P is for part, to share out the load
Q is for queue, process one at a time
R is for reader, I can't think of a rhyme
S is for source, and you're doing great
T is for time, 429 makes you wait
U is for user, like you'll be one day
V is for value, associated to k
W is for word, collections of c
X is for x-component when doing 3D
Y is for y-component like x is again
Z is for z-component, we got to the end!
